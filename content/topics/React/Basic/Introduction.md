React is a js library for building frontend application with ease.

## Features of React

- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which allows it to make updates efficiently by only changing the necessary parts of the real DOM.
- **View Oriented**: React focuses on building and rendering the user interface, adhering to the concept of "View" in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data in React flows in a single direction, making state management predictable and debugging easier.
- **Component-Based**: React applications are built using reusable, modular components, which helps maintain clean and scalable codebases.
